<h1>Downloading (or Cloning) the system</h1>
Open your Terminal <br>
Change directory into any directory of your choice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd directory <br>
Clone the software <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git clone https://github.com/rrubino/B6-SFB1102.git

<h1>Pre-requirements</h1>

<ul>

<li> Python Programming Language</li>
<li> Natural Laguage Toolkit (NLTK)</li>
<li> Scikit Library</li>
<li> Pattern Library</li>

</ul>


<h1>Configuration</h1>


This is where you set the parameters (features, classifiers etc.) for running the program <br>
Open the tesconfig.txt using a text editor (e.g. gedit textconfig.txt) <br><br>

Find the line that starts with “<b>input files </b>:”. <br> On this line you are to input two file paths. <br> The first path is the path to the file containing the sentences (original and translated)
 for training and testing and the second path is the path containing the labels or classes of the sentences. <br>
input files : path/to/sentences.txt &nbsp; path/to/classes.txt <br> 
The sentences.txt file (from the line above) must contain a sentence (or block) per line while the classes.txt file must contain a label per line. Both files must have the same number of lines <br><br>


Find the line that starts with “<b>output classifier</b> :”. <br> On this line you are to input a path which would be a path to a file that would contain results of the classification (Accuracy, precision, recall and fscore).
output classifier: path/to/classificationResults.txt <br> <br>

Find the line that starts with “<b>classifiers </b>:”. <br> On this line you will input the names of the classifiers you intend to experiment with separated by spaces.
classifiers : DecisionTree &nbsp; RandomForest &nbsp; SVM <br>
You must input at least one of these. But which one of them and how many you choose is up to you <br> <br>

On the line that starts with “ <b> language model </b> :”  <br> you are to input a path to a file that contains sentences from which you intend to create a language model which you might need for some feature extraction modules. <br>
language model: &nbsp; path/to/file.txt <br> <br>

<h2>Feature Configuration</h2>
Features are specified using feature ids followed by their parameters. Feature ids are number and parameters are separated by commas while the parameters are separated from the feature id by space.
In general, to specify a feature with feature id ID and parameters A,B,C, you simply type
ID A,B,C
